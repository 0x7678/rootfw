/**
 * This class is used to share the same RootFW instance across multiple classes and methods. It stores the instance in a static property, until some method disconnects from the shell.
 * <br />
 * It also has the option to lock a connection, which makes sure that it is not disconnected until it get's unlocked again. Each time lock is called, a additional lock is added, making it possible for multiple methods to keep a lock on the connection. First until all locks are removed can the connection be closed. This ensures that any method can call disconnect, without first checking if others are using the connection.
 * <br />
 * As this class is an extender, is should not be called directly. Instead use the static methods RootFW.userInstance() and RootFW.rootInstance() to get one of the shared instances.
 *
